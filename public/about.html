<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Maria, I'm 21 years old and I'm a 3rd year 
  Computer Science student at Tehnical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
</p>

<p>I'm a very energic person, I love nature, video games 
  and I like to spend most of my free time with family, friends
  or watching a good movie.
  One of my biggest passion is programming. 
  My first contact with a programming language was
  in highschool in the 9th grade and that was the moment 
  I decided I want to study informatics more and more every day since then because I find it very interesting.
  That is also the reason I applied for a Computer Science degree.
</p>

<p>At the moment, I'm looking for a job in IT field on a position of Web Developer
  so I can improve my technical skills in terms of programming and why not,
  to improve my English.
 </p>

 <p>On the previous page, there are some projects in HTML
    I'm currently working on. I hope you enjoy it!
  </p>

  <p>If you have any question, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
